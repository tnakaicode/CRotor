Warp10b.esprop Database
----------------------

This database is compatible with ESPARA and ESPROP 0.8 or later.

This ESPROP database contains data for 10 types of WarpDrive blade 
in a 3-blade configuration. 5 diameters are present, from 55 to 71 
inches, in two styles - straight and tapered.

This database was calculated by XROTOR 6.7 using an early version 
of ESPARA. No nacelle or structural corrections were employed. 
It is suitable for test purposes for the following reasons:

1. It is fairly substantial.

2. The various WarpDrive blades are in fact the same blade cut 
to length, and with a 20cm taper machined off the tips of the 
tapered versions. Thus the consistency and resolution of the 
XROTOR/ESPARA/ESPROP parametric analysis system quickly becomes 
apparent.

2. Several unconverged operating points exist in the database, 
in particular for the WD55-std. While these points could likely 
now be converged with subsequent experience and refinements to 
ESPARA, they are left unconverged so that ESPROP's handling of 
unconverged points can be demonstrated. 

Several unconverged points exist for the WD55-std in the 
vicinity of:
180 kts
50-70 hp
1800 rpm

It is suggested that ESPROP's handling of unconverged points be 
observed by directing these points to both numeric and plot output.
