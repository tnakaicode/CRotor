XROTOR restart files CR1.xrotor and CR2.xrotor are provided to
facilitate quick evaluation of CROTOR. These rotors were designed 
following the procedure given in CRotor_doc, with the forward 
rotor as produced by the MIL design routine and the aft rotor 
adjusted in MODI.

- Load XROTOR and go into CROTOR (CROT).
- Import CR1.xrotor as forward rotor (LFWD)
- Import CR2.xrotor as aft rotor (LAFT)
- Go to INPU and enter the following parameters:
  Power 80,000 W (total)
  Rpm 3000 (both rotors)
  Velocity 35 m/s

The RPM or POWE command will now converge the CR system. 
Note that aft rotor geometry has been adjusted to achieve
similar loading as the forward rotor and removal of the
tangential slipstream.

Adjust the Default Input then run RPM or POWE again, or use 
RPM or POWE with command input, to converge the system at 
different design points. Use FWD or AFT to run either rotor 
in the current slipstream.
