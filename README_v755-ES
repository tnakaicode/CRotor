README CROTOR v755-ES1.0 
---------------------------------------------------------------

Makefiles are currently Ubuntu/gfortran (just make sure gfortran 
and xorg-dev are installed). Or configure config.make (plotlib) 
and Makefile (bin) for your system. The other Makefiles include 
Esotec sources but have not been tested. 

cd ... /plotlib
make

cd ... /bin
make

The ESPROP utility is included in the build. The esotec directory 
contains a sample ESPROP database along with XROTOR restart files 
and airfoil sets to expedite evaluation of CROTOR and ESLOFTX.
